Facade Pattern :

The facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides the client with an interface for accessing parts of the system which could be hidden to avoid showing the complexity of the code. Basically, a facade can be applied, when you are working with a complex set of objects, which you do not want to track.

The players' actions will be executed through a class called Game that represents our facade:

class Game is
  method walk() is
    ...
    return new Render()

  method jump() is
    ...
    return new Calculate()

  method startGame() is
    ...
    return new Load()

Facade implementation
Facade implementation in the client code will look pretty boring:
Game game = new Game()
game.startGame()
game.walk()
game.jump()
