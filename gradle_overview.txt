Gradle Overview :

Gradle is a modern automation tool that helps build and manage projects written in Java, Kotlin, Scala, and other JVM-based languages. 
One of the best things about Gradle is its Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) that gives developers a specific way to form custom build scripts.

The key concepts

The key features of Gradle are as follows:
* Settings files. Gradle uses several types of settings files to describe how to build a project.
* Build-by-convention. A programmer doesn't need to specify every building step that needs to be done. Instead, Gradle uses default settings and behavior. Although, every step of the default build process can be customized if necessary.
* Dependency management. Gradle automatically downloads specified external libraries and solves conflict cases with dependencies. You can declare as many dependencies as you need for a project.
* Builds. Gradle allows programmers to design well-structured and easily maintained comprehensible builds. It also supports complex cases such as multi-project or partial builds.
* Ease of migration. Gradle can easily adapt to any project structure you have. Therefore, you can always develop your project exactly the way you want.
* DSL (based on Groovy and Kotlin) for writing scripts in settings files.
