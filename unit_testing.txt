Unit testing :

Steps to test a unit
The main idea of unit testing is to isolate a specific unit and check that it works properly.
Generally, each unit behaves in a similar way: it consumes input data, performs some action on it and produces output data. We can use this behavior to verify the code. The test goes through the following stages:
* We create two datasets: the input and the expected output;
* We define acceptance criteria: some conditions determining if the unit works as expected (usually, the acceptance criterion is a comparison of the actual output with the expected one);
* We pass the created input dataset to the tested unit;
* The input invokes code of the tested unit;
* The code produces an output;
* The produced output is checked by the acceptance criteria, which compares the actual output with the expected one;
* Acceptance criteria return the result: pass or fail.
